## Roles

### The Third-Party Application: \"Client\"

The client is the application that is attempting to get access to
the user\'s account. It needs to get permission from the user before
it can do so.

### The API: \"Resource Server\"

The resource server is the API server used to access the user\'s
information.

### The Authorization Server

This is the server that presents the interface where the user
approves or denies the request. In smaller implementations, this may
be the same server as the API server, but larger scale deployments
will often build this as a separate component.

### The User: \"Resource Owner\"

The resource owner is the person who is giving access to some
portion of their account.

## Creating an App

Before you can begin the OAuth process, you must first register a
new app with the service. When registering a new app, you usually
register basic information such as application name, website, a
logo, etc. In addition, you must register a redirect URI to be used
for redirecting users to for web server, browser-based, or mobile
apps.

### Redirect URIs

The service will only redirect users to a registered URI, which
helps prevent some attacks. Any HTTP redirect URIs must be served
via HTTPS. This helps prevent tokens from being intercepted during
the authorization process. Native apps may register a redirect URI
with a custom URL scheme for the application, which may look like
`demoapp://redirect`.

### Client ID and Secret

After registering your app, you will receive a client ID and
optionally a client secret. The client ID is considered public
information, and is used to build login URLs, or included in
Javascript source code on a page. The client secret **must** be kept
confidential. If a deployed app cannot keep the secret confidential,
such as single-page Javascript apps or native apps, then the secret
is not used, and ideally the service shouldn\'t issue a secret to
these types of apps in the first place.

## Authorization

The first step of OAuth 2 is to get authorization from the user. For
browser-based or mobile apps, this is usually accomplished by
displaying an interface provided by the service to the user.

OAuth 2 provides several \"grant types\" for different use cases.
The grant types defined are:

-   **Authorization Code** for apps running on a [web
    server](#web-server-apps), [browser-based](#browser-based-apps)
    and [mobile apps](#mobile-apps)
-   **Password** for logging in with a [username and
    password](#other-app-types) (only for first-party apps)
-   **Client credentials** for [application
    access](#client-credentials) without a user present
-   **Implicit** was previously recommended for clients without a
    secret, but has been superseded by using the Authorization Code
    grant with PKCE.

Each use case is described in detail below.

## Web Server Apps

Web server apps are the most common type of application you
encounter when dealing with OAuth servers. Web apps are written in a
server-side language and run on a server where the source code of
the application is not available to the public. This means the
application is able to use its client secret when communicating with
the authorization server, which can help avoid many attack vectors.

### Authorization

Create a \"Log In\" link sending the user to:

    https://authorization-server.com/auth?response_type=code&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=photos&state=1234zyx

-   **response_type=code** - Indicates that your server expects to
    receive an authorization code
-   **client_id** - The client ID you received when you first
    created the application
-   **redirect_uri** - Indicates the URI to return the user to after
    authorization is complete
-   **scope** - One or more scope values indicating which parts of
    the user\'s account you wish to access
-   **state** - A random string generated by your application, which
    you\'ll verify later

The user sees the authorization prompt

![OAuth Authorization
Prompt](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/oauth-authorization-prompt.png)

If the user clicks \"Allow,\" the service redirects the user back to
your site with an authorization code

    https://example-app.com/cb?code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&state=1234zyx

-   **code** - The server returns the authorization code in the
    query string
-   **state** - The server returns the same state value that you
    passed

You should first compare this state value to ensure it matches the
one you started with. You can typically store the state value in a
cookie or session, and compare it when the user comes back. This
helps ensure your redirection endpoint isn\'t able to be tricked
into attempting to exchange arbitrary authorization codes.

### Getting an Access Token

Your server exchanges the authorization code for an access token by
making a POST request to the authorization server\'s token endpoint:

    POST https://api.authorization-server.com/token
      grant_type=authorization_code&
      code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&
      redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID&
      client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET

-   **grant_type=authorization_code** - The grant type for this flow
    is authorization_code
-   **code=AUTH_CODE_HERE** - This is the code you received in the
    query string
-   **redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI** - Must be identical to the
    redirect URI provided in the original link
-   **client_id=CLIENT_ID** - The client ID you received when you
    first created the application
-   **client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET** - Since this request is made
    from server-side code, the secret is included

The server replies with an access token and expiration time

    {
      "access_token":"RsT5OjbzRn430zqMLgV3Ia",
      "expires_in":3600
    }

or if there was an error

    {
      "error":"invalid_request"
    }

Security: Note that the service must require apps to pre-register
their redirect URIs.

[]{#browser-based-apps}

## Single-Page Apps

Single-page apps (or browser-based apps) run entirely in the browser
after loading the source code from a web page. Since the entire
source code is available to the browser, they cannot maintain the
confidentiality of a client secret, so the secret is not used in
this case. The flow is based on the authorization code flow above,
but with the addition of a dynamically generated secret used on each
request. This is known as the [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce)
extension.

::: {.inline-banner}
Note: Previously, it was recommended that browser-based apps use the
\"Implicit\" flow, which returns an access token immediately in the
redirect and does not have a token exchange step. In the time since
the spec was originally written, the industry best practice has
changed to recommend that the authorization code flow be used
without the client secret. This provides more opportunities to
create a secure flow, such as using the [PKCE
extension](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/). Further reading: [OAuth 2.0
Security Best Current
Practice](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics)
(ietf.org), [OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based
Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-parecki-oauth-browser-based-apps)
(ietf.org).
:::

### Authorization

Create a random string between 43-128 characters long, then generate
the url-safe base64-encoded SHA256 hash of the string. The original
random string is known as the `code_verifier`, and the hashed
version is known as the `code_challenge`.

Create a random string (code verifier), e.g.
`5d2309e5bb73b864f989753887fe52f79ce5270395e25862da6940d5`

Create the SHA256 hash, then base64-encode the string (code
challenge): `MChCW5vD-3h03HMGFZYskOSTir7II_MMTb8a9rJNhnI`

(You can use the helper utility at
[example-app.com/pkce](https://example-app.com/pkce) to generate a
secret and hash.)

Create a \"Log In\" link like the authorization code flow above, but
now include the code challenge in the request:

    https://authorization-server.com/auth?response_type=code&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=photos&state=1234zyx&code_challenge=CODE_CHALLENGE&code_challenge_method=S256

-   **response_type=code** - Indicates that your server expects to
    receive an authorization code
-   **client_id** - The client ID you received when you first
    created the application
-   **redirect_uri** - Indicates the URI to return the user to after
    authorization is complete
-   **scope** - One or more scope values indicating which parts of
    the user\'s account you wish to access
-   **state** - A random string generated by your application, which
    you\'ll verify later
-   **code_challenge** - The URL-safe base64-encoded SHA256 hash of
    the secret
-   **code_challenge_method=S256** - Indicate which hashing method
    you used (S256)

The user sees the authorization prompt

![OAuth Authorization
Prompt](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/oauth-authorization-prompt.png)

If the user clicks \"Allow,\" the service redirects the user back to
your site with an auth code

    https://example-app.com/cb?code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&state=1234zyx

-   **code** - The server returns the authorization code in the
    query string
-   **state** - The server returns the same state value that you
    passed

You should first compare this state value to ensure it matches the
one you started with. You can typically store the state value in a
cookie, and compare it when the user comes back. This ensures your
redirection endpoint isn\'t able to be tricked into attempting to
exchange arbitrary authorization codes.

You can find a complete example of using PKCE in JavaScript in my
blog post [Is the OAuth Implicit Flow
Dead?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/05/01/is-the-oauth-implicit-flow-dead)

### Getting an Access Token

Now you\'ll need to exchange the authorization code for an access
token, but instead of providing a pre-registered client secret, you
send the PKCE secret you generated at the beginning of the flow.

    POST https://api.authorization-server.com/token
      grant_type=authorization_code&
      code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&
      redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID&
      code_verifier=CODE_VERIFIER

-   **grant_type=authorization_code** - The grant type for this flow
    is authorization_code
-   **code=AUTH_CODE_HERE** - This is the code you received in the
    query string
-   **redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI** - Must be identical to the
    redirect URI provided in the original link
-   **client_id=CLIENT_ID** - The client ID you received when you
    first created the application
-   **code_verifier=CODE_VERIFIER** - The random secret you
    generated at the beginning

The authorization server will hash the verifier and compare it to
the challenge sent in the request, and only issue the access token
if they match. This ensures that even if someone was able to
intercept the authorization code, they will not be able to use it to
get an access token since they won\'t have the secret.

## Mobile Apps

Like browser-based apps, mobile apps also cannot maintain the
confidentiality of a client secret. Because of this, mobile apps
also use the PKCE flow which does not require a client secret. There
are some additional concerns that mobile apps should keep in mind to
ensure the security of the OAuth flow.

Note: Previously, it was recommended that mobile and native apps use
the Implicit grant. In the time since the spec was originally
written, the industry best practice has changed to recommend using
the authorization code flow with no secret for native apps. There
are some [additional
recommendations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252) for native
apps that are worth reading as well.

### Authorization

Create a \"Log in\" button sending the user to either the native app
of the service on the phone, or a mobile web page for the service.
Apps can register a custom URI scheme such as \"example-app://\" so
the native app is launched whenever a URL with that protocol is
visited, or they can register URL patterns which will launch the
native app if a URL matching the pattern is visited.

#### Using the Service\'s Native App

If the user has the native Facebook app installed, direct them to
the following URL:

    fbauth2://authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID
      &redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=email&state=1234zyx

-   **response_type=code** - indicates that your server expects to
    receive an authorization code
-   **client_id=CLIENT_ID** - The client ID you received when you
    first created the application
-   **redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI** - Indicates the URI to return the
    user to after authorization is complete, such as
    `fb00000000://authorize`
-   **scope=email** - One or more scope values indicating which
    parts of the user\'s account you wish to access
-   **state=1234zyx** - A random string generated by your
    application, which you\'ll verify later

For servers that support the [PKCE
extension](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) (and if you\'re building a
server, you should support the PKCE extension), you\'ll also include
the following parameters. First, create a \"code verifier\" which is
a random string that the app stores locally.

-   **code_challenge=XXXXXXX** - This is a base64-encoded version of
    the sha256 hash of the code verifier string
-   **code_challenge_method=S256** - Indicates the hashing method
    used to compute the challenge, in this case, sha256.

Note that your redirect URI will probably look like
`fb00000000://authorize` where the protocol is a custom URL scheme
that your app has registered with the OS.

#### Using a Web Browser

If the service does not have a native application, you can launch a
mobile browser to the standard web authorization URL. Note that you
should never use an embedded web view in your own application, as
this provides the user no guarantee that they are actually are
entering their password in the service\'s website rather than a
phishing site.

You should either launch the native mobile browser, or use the new
iOS \"SafariViewController\" to launch an embedded browser in your
application. This API was added in iOS 9, and provides a mechanism
to launch a browser inside the application that both shows the
address bar so the user can confirm they\'re on the correct website,
and also shares cookies with the real Safari browser. It also
prevents the application from inspecting and modifying the contents
of the browser, so can be considered secure.

    https://facebook.com/dialog/oauth?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID
      &redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=email&state=1234zyx

Again, if the service supports PKCE, then those parameters should be
included as well as described above.

-   **response_type=code** - indicates that your server expects to
    receive an authorization code
-   **client_id=CLIENT_ID** - The client ID you received when you
    first created the application
-   **redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI** - Indicates the URI to return the
    user to after authorization is complete, such as
    `fb00000000://authorize`
-   **scope=email** - One or more scope values indicating which
    parts of the user\'s account you wish to access
-   **state=1234zyx** - A random string generated by your
    application, which you\'ll verify later

The user will see the authorization prompt

![Facebook Authorization
Prompt](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/everyday-city-auth.png)

### Getting an Access Token

After clicking \"Approve\", the user will be redirected back to your
application with a URL like

    fb00000000://authorize?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=1234zyx

Your mobile application should first verify that the state
corresponds to the state that was used in the initial request, and
can then exchange the authorization code for an access token.

The token exchange will look the same as exchanging the code in the
web server app case, except that the secret is not sent. If the
server supports PKCE, then you will need to include an additional
parameter as described below.

    POST https://api.authorization-server.com/token
      grant_type=authorization_code&
      code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&
      redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID&
      code_verifier=VERIFIER_STRING

-   **grant_type=authorization_code** - The grant type for this flow
    is authorization_code
-   **code=AUTH_CODE_HERE** - This is the code you received in the
    query string
-   **redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI** - Must be identical to the
    redirect URI provided in the original link
-   **client_id=CLIENT_ID** - The client ID you received when you
    first created the application
-   **code_verifier=VERIFIER_STRING** - The plaintext string that
    you previously hashed to create the code_challenge

The authorization server will verify this request and return an
access token.

If the server supports PKCE, then the authorization server will
recognize that this code was generated with a code challenge, and
will hash the provided plaintext and confirm that the hashed version
corresponds with the hashed string that was sent in the initial
authorization request. This ensures the security of using the
authorization code flow with clients that don\'t support a secret.

## Other Grant Types {#others}

### Password

OAuth 2 also provides a \"password\" grant type which can be used to
exchange a username and password for an access token directly. Since
this obviously requires the application to collect the user\'s
password, it must only be used by apps created by the service
itself. For example, the native Twitter app could use this grant
type to log in on mobile or desktop apps.

To use the password grant type, simply make a POST request like the
following:

    POST https://api.authorization-server.com/token
      grant_type=password&
      username=USERNAME&
      password=PASSWORD&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID

-   **grant_type=password** - The grant type for this flow is
    password
-   **username=USERNAME** - The user\'s username as collected by the
    application
-   **password=PASSWORD** - The user\'s password as collected by the
    application
-   **client_id=CLIENT_ID** - The client ID you received when you
    first created the application

The server replies with an access token in the same format as the
other grant types.

Note, the client secret is not included here under the assumption
that most of the use cases for password grants will be mobile or
desktop apps, where the secret cannot be protected.

### Application access {#client-credentials}

In some cases, applications may need an access token to act on
behalf of themselves rather than a user. For example, the service
may provide a way for the application to update their own
information such as their website URL or icon, or they may wish to
get statistics about the users of the app. In this case,
applications need a way to get an access token for their own
account, outside the context of any specific user. OAuth provides
the `client_credentials` grant type for this purpose.

To use the client credentials grant type, make a POST request like
the following:

    POST https://api.authorization-server.com/token
        grant_type=client_credentials&
        client_id=CLIENT_ID&
        client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET

The response will include an access token in the same format as the
other grant types.

## Making Authenticated Requests

The end result of all the grant types is obtaining an access token.

Now that you have an access token, you can make requests to the API.
You can quickly make an API request using cURL as follows:

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer RsT5OjbzRn430zqMLgV3Ia" \
    https://api.authorization-server.com/1/me

That\'s it! Make sure you always send requests over HTTPS and never
ignore invalid certificates. HTTPS is the only thing protecting
requests from being intercepted or modified.

## Differences from OAuth 1.0 {#differences}

OAuth 1.0 was largely based on existing proprietary protocols such
as Flickr\'s \"FlickrAuth\" and Google\'s \"AuthSub\". The result
represented the best solution based on actual implementation
experience. However, after several years of working with the
protocol, the community learned enough to rethink and improve the
protocol in three main areas where OAuth 1.0 proved limited or
confusing.

You can read more about this in detail in my book [OAuth 2.0
Simplified](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/differences-between-oauth-1-2/).
